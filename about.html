    <p id="aboutText" >
        As a child, I enjoyed watching advertisements and thinking about the psychology of persuasion that made successful advertisements work. I always questioned why people act the way they do. My search for answers to these questions led me to a career in marketing and communications.
        <br><br>
        In August 2021, I am graduating with the highest honor from Georgia Tech with a master’s degree in Global Media and Cultures with a concentration in German. Since May 2021, I am holding a position as Digital Marketing intern at Siemens in Atlanta, GA. Previously, I have worked as a Marketing Assistant for the German American Chamber of Commerce of the Southern U.S. and as Assistant Coordinator for National Communications of the Graduate Programs of the School of Modern Languages at Georgia Tech.
        <br><br>
        My skills include developing marketing strategies and campaigns, content creation, email marketing, web marketing, and web design. I have hands-on experience in film making, graphic design, creating podcasts, and programming. I especially love learning new marketing techniques and tools and using the right side of my brain while I am a brilliant strategic thinker.

        Before moving to the US in 2019, I graduated with a degree in Social Sciences with a focus on Communications, Media, and Politics at the Universität Koblenz-Landau, in Landau in der Pfalz, Germany. 
        During my undergraduate studies, I studied abroad twice, at Rhodes College in Memphis and at the University of Tampere in Finland. 
        After graduating with my bachelor’s degree during the height of refugee migration to Europe, I felt the call to public service and worked as a refugee and integration manager for my municipality in Germany.
